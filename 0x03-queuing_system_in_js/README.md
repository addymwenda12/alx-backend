## 0x03 Queuing System

### Description
This project aims to develop a queuing system using Javascript. Queuing systems are essential components in many applications, particularly those that handle concurrent tasks or manage resources efficiently. By implementing a queuing system in Javascript, we can explore concepts such as asynchronous programming, event-driven architecture, and efficient task management.

### Features:

1. `Queue Implementation`: Develop a robust queue data structure in JavaScript.
2. `Task Management`: Allow users to enqueue and dequeue tasks efficiently.
3. `Concurrency Handling`   : Handle concurrent tasks effectively to prevent race conditions and ensure data integrity.
4. `Event-driven Design`: Utilize event-driven architecture to manage task execution and notification.
5. `Error Handling`: Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage exceptions and failures.
6. `Performance Optimization`: Optimize the queuing system for performance, scalability, and resource utilization.

### Getting Started:

Navigate to the project directory: 
```bash
cd 0x03-queuing_system_in_js
```
Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
Run the queuing system:
```bash
node index.js
```

### Usage:

1. Initialize the queuing system.
2. Enqueue tasks to be processed.
3. Dequeue tasks for execution.
4. Handle task completion events or errors as necessary.
